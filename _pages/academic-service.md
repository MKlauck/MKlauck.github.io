## PhD Representative Center for Perspicuous Computing (CPEC)
In the collaborative Research Center 248 -- Foundations of Perspicuous Software Systems, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), I was the PhD representative on the CPEC Board from May 2020 to December 2022. My main tasks were the conception and organization of measures for the promotion of young scientists. Read more about it [here](/projects/).

## Reviewing -- Conferences
* ICCPS: ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems, **member of the program committee**, 2025.
* QEST: International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation of Systems, **member of the program committee**, 2023.
* ISoLA: International Symposium On Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation, 2022
* MEMOCODE: International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for System Design, 2021.
* TACAS: International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems, 2017--2022.

In addition, I assisted in the organization of the 35th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science LICS and the 47th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming ICALP 2020 held online but hosted in Saarbr√ºcken.

## Reviewing -- Artifact Evaluation Committees
* QEST: International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation of Systems, 2022.
* ADHS: Conference on Analysis and Design of Hybrid Systems, 2021.
* TACAS: International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems, 2020.

## Tooling Competitions & Benchmarks
* Development of [QComp](https://qcomp.org/), the Comparison of Tools for the Analysis of Quantitative Formal Models Competition with colleagues. It is a friendly competition among verification and analysis tools for quantitative formal models and compares the performance, versatility, and usability of the participating tools. It took place in 2019 at TOOLympics at TACAS for the first time, where I was involved in the development process of the event. In 2020, I was part of the organization team and responsible for the technical setup and tool execution of the competition.
*  Development of the [Quantitative Verification Benchmark Set (QVBS)](https://qcomp.org/benchmarks/), a collection of probabilistic models (MDP, MA, CTMC, DTMC, PTA) in JANI, PRISM, etc. for benchmarking in the model checking community with colleagues.
