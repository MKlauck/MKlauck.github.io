## Theses Supervision

I am currently supervising the PhD Thesis of Matteo Palmas and the Master's thesis of Geetansh Saxena at Bosch Research in the CONVINCE project. 

In addition, I was involved in the supervision of Marcel Vinzent’s Bachelor’s thesis “Dead-End Pattern Databases in PRISM” and his research immersion lab “Implementing FRET/LRTDP in an explicit-state engine for JANI”, as well as in Govinda Sicheneder’s Master’s thesis “Time-bound Latency for Bluetooth Low Energy and Isochronous Channels in a Time-Critical Bicycle Application”.

## ACM SIGSOFT Summer School for Software Engineering in Robotics
Member of the core organizing team of the summer school from 4th to 8th June 2024 in Brussels. More information can be found on the [school's webpage](https://www.scivenia.com/en/event/summer-school-for-software-engineering-in-robotics_993/). This involved acquisition of ACM SIGSOFT funding.
Funding for a second iteration in 2025 was just granted. 
In both years I am part of the team responsible for the full organization of the event, incl. venue location, food, social activities, etc. 
In addition, I give a full day fundamental lecture on verification, formal methods in general, and model checking for robust robot deliberation.

## Mathematics Precourse of Computer Science 

The Mathematics Precourse of Computer Science at Saarland University is a four-week full-time course where ca. 30 volunteers organize daily lectures, tutorials with exercises and homework, as well as an exam to prepare students for their studies in the area of computer science at Saarland University. In this course the mathematical and logical background needed for the introductory mathematics and programming lectures are tough. In addition, social events to help the new students to get to know their fellows are organized. The team got awarded with the BeStE-Preis of Saarland University in 2017 for extraordinary student commitment.
